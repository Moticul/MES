## Details 

- **What kind of processor is it?**

STM32F303VCT6 Microcontroller 

- **How much Flash and RAM does it have? Any other memory types?**

256 Kilobytes of Flash and 48 Kilobytes of RAM

- **Does it have any special peripherals? (List 3-5 that you find interesting)**

1. 3x-axis Gyroscope
2. Acceleration Sensor 
3. Magnetic Sensor

- **If it has an ADC, what are the features?**

The ADC on the discovery board is used to convert a voltage applied to a given Anal Input channel. ADC1's Channel 7 is located on PC1 of the devboard.

- **How much does the board cost vs what the processor costs? Is the processor in stock anywhere? (Try Digikey, Mouser, Octopart, Google, and so on.)**

The Discovery board is  $16.43 per board and is available direct from STMicroelectronics. 
The STM32F303VCT6 MCU pricing starts at $9.95 per unit for quantities of 1-9 units. With discounts on unit pricing for higher volume quantities.
